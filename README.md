CSS Drop Down Menu Tutorial-
http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/create-simple-css-dropdown-menu

    I decided to find a drop down menu tutorial for this assignment. Although there are many different extremes of menu layouts, I decided to try a simple one first. I thought it still seemed complicated, but now have an idea of how it's all put together. Having a video to work along with is very helpful when doing a tutorial. I also think it is helpful to have text instructions available. 
    
    In this tutorial they had a video to go along with. They also provided the project files download. I was able to work along with the video and get additional ideas/help from the project files download. I didn't want to have anything be the exact same, but still worked along with the tutorial and got an end result of a simple drop down menu. 
    
    This website in general seems like it is a very helpful website. This main tutorial seemed to be very clear, not much overloaded, since the code was included in a download file. I also liked how there is an option for feedback. I personally like to read through some of the feedback/comments before trying/buying something. I don't like how you need to sign up for the website to have full access, but I understand that it is including many helpful learning tools.
